    result = g.directions("Fittjav√§gen 1 Norsborg", "Slottsbacken 1 Stockholm", "sv")

Lets get the directions. An array of string will be returned.

    directions_array = result[:directions]

Print out the directions in steps.

    directions_array.each do |step|
        #Print out Ex. {Continue forward to the end of the road, 1 km, 2 minutes
        puts step.route + ", " + step.distance + ", " step.duration
    end

How about the distance information (in total)!? A string will be returned.

    #Ex. 7 km
    distance = result[:distance]

And the duration of time (in total)? A string will be returned.

    #Ex. 17 minutes
    duration = result[:duration]
